# PyDDM_DMC

An implementation of the diffusion process model (Diffusion Model for Conflict Tasks, DMC) presented in "Automatic
and controlled stimulus processing in conflict tasks: Superimposed diffusion processes and delta functions"
(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010028515000195)

## Parametrization and Implementation

Parametrization and implementation is taken from "DMCfun: An R package for fitting Diffusion Model of Conflict (DMC)
to reaction time and error rate data" (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S259026012100031X). 
The R-package corresponding to the original implementation can be found at https://github.com/igmmgi/DMCfun.
